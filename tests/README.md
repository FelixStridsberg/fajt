# Integration tests

These are reusable test cases that can be use for testing any part of the
parsing and code generation process.

All tests that go here must...
- Be parseable
- Be properly formatted (so codegen can compare input with output)

Failing tests and tests that can not be properly formatted should go in the
proper workspace instead.
