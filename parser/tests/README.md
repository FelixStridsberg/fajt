# Parser specific tests

These are tests specific for the parser, most test cases should go in the
root [tests](../../tests) folder for reuse when testing the other crates.

Test cases should only go here if they...
- ... fails during parsing
- ... requires optional semi colons to be missing
- ... requires syntax to be improperly formatted
